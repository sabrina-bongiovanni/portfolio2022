      "Born translator and linguistic mediator, turned Front-End developer. have a BA in Intercultural and Linguistic Mediation, with 2+ years of experience as a translator in a software house, where I had the chance to really get close and dive into the coding world. I attended the SheCodes Plus course to start my journey in the coding world, and now I'm attending the Domestika Introduction to PHP course, as well as Udemy Angular and React course. My skills as a translator and localizer translate really well into the coding world, as the challenges hidden in learning languages and finding out the best solutions to translate a text from a language to another have really allowed me to understand how to structure efficient code and to work around even the toughest, seemingly impossible-to-solve problems in coding.",
